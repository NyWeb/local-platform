As this develops, it will replace an old legacy application costing around £1M a year to maintain but is impossible to change.<br /><br />We believe we can use this code, approach and technology standards used to, with the support of other local councils, develop a SaaS based platform that can be used across Local Government and severely reduce the cost of running digital local government services.<br /><br />This could save the public sector billions of pounds a year.

    "description": "We believe that the fastest, and safest way to perform the ETL is to build and deploy an adapter service that allows the frontend to read documents from both the old and the new data store and present them to the user in the most seamless way possible.<br /><br />We recognise that this is likely to be difficult in a legacy system, we will validate its feasibility early in the engagement, alongside the delivery of the find an assessor component. Our backup approach is to make discrete slices of the query space` and bring traffic to the new system in slices of increasing size and complexity. Both of these approaches are detailed in this section.  We note that the existing system appears to maintain GUIDs of addresses. We could temporarily index these GUIDs into our proposed Address Indexing Service, this will allow us to create a hybrid between the adapter approach and a “big bang” migration, where we can intelligently send users to the correct service while migration is ongoing.",
    "content": "Our preferred approach is to build new front ends and services which are temporarily connected to the data via an adapter service.<br /><br />This service will transparently query both the new and the old datastore, allowing for service continuity while migration and data cleansing is carried out.<br /><br />We believe this will de-risk the project by avoiding a big bang migration, as well as move traffic to the new system as early as possible, building operational confidence."
